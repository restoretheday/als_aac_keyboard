# What To Do Next - Super Simple! 😊

## Good News! 🎉
I've already set up most things for you:
- ✅ Flutter is installed
- ✅ Your app's code libraries are downloaded
- ✅ Everything is ready to go!

## The One Big Thing Left: Install Xcode

**Xcode is like a toolbox for making iPhone and iPad apps.** You need it to test your app on a phone simulator.

### How to Install Xcode:

1. **Open the App Store** on your Mac (the blue icon with an "A")

2. **Search for "Xcode"** in the search bar

3. **Click the "Get" button** (or "Install" if you see that)

4. **Wait patiently** ⏰
   - This is a BIG download (over 5 GB)
   - It might take 30-60 minutes depending on your internet
   - You can keep using your computer while it downloads

5. **After it finishes downloading:**
   - Open Xcode from your Applications folder
   - It will ask to install extra tools - click "Install"
   - Wait for that to finish

### After Xcode is Installed:

Come back here and I'll help you finish the setup! Or follow the `CHECKLIST.md` file I made for you.

## What Happens After Xcode?

Once Xcode is installed, you'll need to:
1. Set up Xcode (I'll give you the commands)
2. Install CocoaPods (one more tool - quick!)
3. Install the Flutter extension in Cursor
4. Run your app! 🚀

But first, let's get Xcode installed. That's the biggest step!
